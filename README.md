I am Suman Barman. I have arround 8 yr experiance in software development. In Technicise I am working for last 5 years. Before that I was doing my Phd in ACSIR, a renouned institute of India govt Council of scientific & Industrial Research.( No I have not completed due to some family reason.) Currently I am working on a telehealth priject. Aimas2health. This is going to live end of next month. Now I work for exclusivly variously health care project in android based mobile development. PHR. EHR, patient portal based application. The language I use is java or kotlin. There are almost 10+ apps live in playstore. 

There are 1 of the app named "Medica kolkata", 1 of the biggest hospital in eastern reason. They have 14 hospital in their chain. We made app for 2 of them. There was doctor search by name or dept or can appointment of doctor.  there was a funtionality name "emergency" by which we could book an ambulance. 

There are an app name MyRx, which is a medical tourism app. Lots of patient come to india from bangladesh for treatment. They dont need to carry document physically. they can upload their documents here and can share there documents with doctor or hospital. 

Digital Anatomy - this app is australia based. we can visualize the anatomy model or doctor can refer anatomy model to patient where is the actual problem. we r using bio-digital framework here.

I also worked in a app where IOMT data collection using HL7 Observation vitalsign and FHIR service used.

I worked for few server less project which is based on firebase function. I worked with Chandra for that, bt my speciality in android. I have worked api level 22 to 30. worked on various api framework like volley, retrofit, loopj. And Also worked on local savings like Room Persistance.

Before Technicise, I was working there for stabilization of MAV, besed on video processing. I worked there in Matlab and system c. Video captured form front mounted camera of MAV. From video have to detect horizon and oriantation of MAV. From detected horizon have to calculate the oriantation angle. Then have to give signal to its controller to take opposite oriantation stabilize to horizontal.

I have spent enough time on frontend. Now its time for me to work on backend.
